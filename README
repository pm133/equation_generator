This program takes a series of cartesian data points
as input and creates an equation of the line (2 data pts), plane (3 data pts), circle (3 data pts), sphere (4 data pts) or general conic (5 data pts) which connects them.

This program is a solution to problems found in the book Applications of Linear Algebra (3rd Ed.) by Chris Rorres and Howard Anton.

A series of homogeneous linear equations are crafted and the c_i coefficients are calculated by forming determinants from the minors of each element in row 1.

Equations are as follows:

c_1*x + c_2*y+ c_3 = 0  (line)

c_1*x + c_2*y+ c_3*z + c_4 = 0  (plane)

c_1*(x^2 + y^2) + c_2*x + c_3*y + c_4 = 0 (circle)

c_1*(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) + c_2*x + c_3*y + c_4*z + c_5 = 0 (sphere)

c_1*x^2 + c_2*x*y + c_3*y^2 + c_4*x + c_5*y + c_6 = 0 (general conic)

From the command line, run:
equation_generator_version_1_0 <shape> <inputfile>

<shape> can be LINE, CIRCLE, PLANE, GEN_CONIC or SPHERE
<inputfile> format should be a text file containing a comma separated 
set of coordinates with the final character being a semi-colon (;) Each co-ordinate with a tuple should be separated by a space. Sample input files are given for each shape. Co-ordinates can be negative, positive, real or integer.

The program has been compiled on Linux and is designed only to run on the command line. GNU Scientific Library is required before this program will compile.

Prerequestites:
GNU Scientific Library (GSL) must be installed.

Known Issues:
1) The lowest common factors in the final equation have not been calculated. Results are presented with coefficients as returned from library routines. Simplifications may need to be performed by hand.

2) Degenerate matrices are not detected and the LU decomposition function will fail for these.
