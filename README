This program takes a series of cartesian data points
as input and creates an equation of the line (2 pts), plane (3 pts), circle (3 pts), sphere (4 pts) or general conic (5 pts) which connects them.

A series of homogeneous linear equations are crafted and the c_i coefficients are calculated by forming determinants from the minors of each element in row 1.

Equations are as follows:

c_1*x + c_2*y+ c_3 = 0  (line)

c_1*x + c_2*y+ c_3*z + c_4 = 0  (plane)

c_1*(x^2 + y^2) + c_2*x + c_3*y + c_4 = 0 (circle)

c_1*(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) + c_2*x + c_3*y + c_4*z + c_5 = 0 (sphere)

c_1*x^2 + c_2*x*y + c_3*y^2 + c_4*x + c_5*y + c_6 = 0 (general conic)

This program was designed to solve the general problems listed in Chapter 1 of the book 
Applications of Linear Algebra by Chris Borres and Howard Anton (3rd edition) and requires the installation
and subsequent use of the GNU Scientific Library.
